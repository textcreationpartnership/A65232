            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Is not the Peace, Welfare, Proſperity, Quietneſs, Happineſs and Tranquillity of all People, the very Cauſe and End of the Inſtitution of all Rule, Authority and juſt Government amongſt men, that all men under it might live a peaceable and quiet life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty? that thereby the unruly might be ruled, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly might be ordered and governed; and the injurious perſon might be prevented and hindred from doing injuriouſly, or puniſhed for the ſame; and that the peaceable and harmleſs might be protected in peace and quietneſs, and good men defended, countenanced and encouraged in well-doing?</p>
            <p>And are not all good and juſt Laws as ſo many Pales, Fences or Bounds, to ſtand between the <hi>Injurious</hi> and the <hi>Innocent,</hi> between the <hi>diſorderly</hi> and the <hi>orderly,</hi> between the <hi>Oppreſſor</hi> and the <hi>Harmleſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Juſt</hi> and the <hi>Unjuſt;</hi> that the one might not break over upon the other, to hurt, injure or deſtroy them in their Lives, Liberties, Perſons or Eſtates, but that all thereby might live in peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs together? And are not ſuch good Laws made (or added) becauſe of tranſgreſſion, and becauſe of a tranſgreſſing nature in mankind, (begotten by the Devil in the Fall) which is not ſubject to the juſt and righteous Law of God, which ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye the ſame unto them;</hi> and is it not becauſe of ſuch injurious men, and for ſuch lawleſs unrighteous evil-doers, who live in that faln ſtate and evil nature, and are not ſubject to the righteous Law of God written in their hearts, which requires them to love God above all, and their neighbours as themſelves; I ſay, is it not for ſuch that Laws are made? and is it not becauſe of ſuch, that Rule and Government amongſt men was appointed and ordained of God? elſe what uſe were there of it in the world? for they that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99944:2"/>are ſubject to the Law of God in their hearts, are thereby bound to peace and quietneſs, and taught to do to others as they would have others do to them, and ſo comes not under mans Law, (as to the condemning power thereof) though they conſent to it to be good and wholſome; neither doth the Law become a terror to them, but rather a protection and a defence, againſt ſuch as would injure them, harm them, or deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>And is not this the end for which Rulers and Magiſtrates are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ordained of God? and is not this their duty towards God and towards man, to uſe all diligence in their ſeveral places and capacities, to endeavour to maintain and keep up thoſe fences and bounds that are made between man and man; and in caſe of breach thereof, or any intrenchment thereupon, to endeavour the repair of ſuch breaches, and to ſtand with their Sword in the gap, between the injurious, and the innocent and harmleſs; turning the edge thereof againſt the evil-doer, for defence of the innocent? And is it not for this end that the Sword of Power and Authority is put into their hand, to terrifie and puniſh all ſuch unruly, diſorderly, injurious, unjuſt, unrighteous Peace-breakers, who will not otherwiſe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from injuring and deſtroying ſuch as deſire to live at peace with all men, and to do to all men as they would be done unto? And is it not in the doing hereof, that Magiſtrates are ſaid to <hi>Rule for God,</hi> and <hi>not to bear the Sword in vain,</hi> as they turn the edge thereof (without reſpect of perſons) againſt ſuch men, and againſt ſuch things which are contrary to his righteous Law? and when they endeavour, as much as in them lieth, the preventing, and alſo the removing of thoſe things which are forbidden of him, and becauſe whereof his Wrath cometh and abideth on mankind, even until whole Kingdoms and great Nations periſh in his Wrath and are deſtroyed? And is it not a duty incumbent upon all Magiſtrates and men in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in order to the faithful diſcharge of their Truſt committed to them of God, and concerning which they are accountable unto him? And is it not even their duty towards God, and towards man, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour as much as in them lies, to ſtop and prevent all thoſe floods and ſtreams of ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs amongſt men, which even overflows, and runs down like a mighty River, whereby the holy Spirit of the Lord is grieved, and wherewith his righteous Soul is vexed from day to day? And is not this their work, and that which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99944:3"/>the Lord requires of them? and if through their negligence or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs herein, or their countenancing or tolerating thereof, or winking thereat, the Lord be ſo long provoked until his Wrath break forth, and his Fury and Indignation be poured out upon ſuch who are under their Government, and for whom they are accountable, and they be deſtroyed in his Wrath; though they periſh in their ſins, yet, will not the Lord in juſtice require their blood at the hands of ſuch Rulers and Magiſtrates, who had power to prevent ſuch things which was the cauſe of their deſtruction, but did it not?</p>
            <p>And ought not you ſeriouſly to conſider theſe things, and to walk ſo in your ſeveral places and capacities as that your conſciences may be clear in the ſight of God, and that you may be clear from the blood of all men? for ſurely you cannot but expect that the righteous God will deal righteouſly, and reward every one according to his deeds done in the body, whether they be good or whether they be evil? And though he be a God long-ſuffering and of tender mercy, yet he will in no wiſe acquit the guilty; and may you not read this at large in holy Scriptures <hi>(which were written afore-time for our learning, upon whom the ends of the world are come)</hi> that though he ſuffered long the provocations of the wicked, yet at laſt (except they turned unto him by unfeigned repentance) his Wrath brake forth againſt them, and he overthrew and deſtroyed them in his fierce Anger and ſore Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and many other Kingdoms and Nations; and are not the ſame ſins which they were guilty of, and which was the cauſe of their overthrow, as great in theſe dayes as in theirs, and as abominable in the ſight of the Lord now as then, and cry as loud in the years of the Lord now as then; and is he not as greatly provoked thereby now as then? and may not his Wrath break forth, and his Judgments be executed, and his Fury be poured-out (in Juſtice) now as then? And is it not then your wiſdom to be conſiderate in theſe weighty matters, which are of ſuch great concernment to you, that you may find a hiding-place in the day when his Wrath is poured forth upon his Enemies?</p>
            <p>And do you indeed judge that the moſt heinous crimes and crying ſins of theſe times, <hi>is difference in Judgment about matters of Religion;</hi> and that ſuch as differ from you in Judgment concerning matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> are the onely evil-doers? Do you believe and judge that People meeting together to wait upon the Lord, and to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99944:3"/>worſhip him according to the perſwaſion of their conſciences, (though differing from you in judgment) is in it ſelf a ſin ſo heinous and a crime ſo great, as that it cryes in the ears of the Lord, and provokes him to VVrath? is this the heinous Abomination of the times? and are theſe the great Offenders againſt God and man, that above all others your eye is upon them, and your Sword drawn forth, and the edge thereof turned againſt them, though you have nothing againſt them of evil-doing, either againſt God or man, but only concerning the VVorſhip of their God, becauſe they differ from you in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the way thereof? and yet muſt ſuch be look'd upon and accounted the greateſt tranſgreſſors, and undergo the greateſt ſtroak of your Power, as the chiefeſt Diſturbers of the Kingdomes peace, and the only Troublers of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> do you believe that this is according to the will of God, and that hereby you pleaſe him, and do that which is accepted of him, and that which he requires of you in order to the diſcharge of your Truſt and the clearing of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? is this <hi>ruling for God,</hi> to turn your Sword againſt ſuch who live in his Fear, and endeavour <hi>to keep a Conſcience void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and towards all men,</hi> only becauſe they cannot bow, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to a way of your preſcribing, contrary to the perſwaſion of their conſciences, though in all lawful things they ſubmit to you, and are ſubject to your Authority, and live honeſtly and walk peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably towards all men? Are there not very heinous crimes and crying ſins, yea great abominations againſt God, that are evidently and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly ſo, and which are not found by ſecret ſearch, but are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly known, and openly committed throughout the Land, and which none dare to plead for or juſtifie; which you cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, neither can you be miſtaken, which doubtleſs you know is ſo in the ſight of God, and whereby he is greatly provoked? and ſhould it not be your care to endeavour a Reformation thereof, and to ſtop the currant thereof? Is this a time to be ſtriving with people and puniſhing them, about diſputable points of Religion, which you your ſelves have not an infallible judgment in, neither indeed doth it belong or appertain to your judgment, or relate to your truſt, it being the prerogative of Chriſt Jeſus, who alone is Judge in theſe caſes, and hath reſerved that power to himſelf, and not given it, or committed it unto any Ruler or Magiſtrate upon Earth, ſo as to force or compel any man, in things pertaining to the VVorſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99944:4"/>of God, whom we are to hear and obey in all things, who is both King and Lawgiver to his People; I ſay, is this a time to be ſtriving about things which are diſputable, and to ſpend your time and imploy your ſelves about ſuch matters, when the Land even overflows with wickedneſs and abomination, which is evident and apparent, and concerning which you cannot doubt or queſtion, but that the Lord is provoked therewith, and which properly doth belong to you to look after, &amp; to endeavour a reformation of? Would you not judg it great imprudence and indiſcretion in that Ship-maſter, whoſe Veſſel having ſprung a leak, whereby himſelf and all that are imbarqued with him are in danger to periſh in the Sea, that when his careful Mariners are diligently imployed in ſtopping the ſame for general preſervation, that even then at that time he ſhould be ſtriving and contending with them, and puniſhing of them, becauſe they differ from him in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about ſome diſputable points of Navigation (which he himſelf hath no certain knowledge of) in order to the bringing of their Ship to its deſired port, though peradventure his judgment be more er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous than theirs, and ſo whilſt he is imploying his time about that which is then needleſs, and neglecting that which is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be done for their preſent preſervation, his Veſſel in the mean time even ſinks under him? And is not this a fit compariſon? and doth it not run parallel with the preſent caſe and ſtate of things at this day? and is it not more needful for you to endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe dangers that are apparent, by endeavouring to ſtop thoſe floods of wickedneſs and unrighteouſneſs, which even overflows the Land, and which may endanger to ſink the whole Bottom (in which all your concernments are imbarqued) under the wrath of Almighty God? and would not this be more ſutable to your Truſt, and tend more to the diſcharging and clearing of your Conſciences, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man? And as for ſuch who differ from you in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about Religion, Faith &amp; Worſhip, it would be your wiſdom to follow wiſe <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s Counſel, and let them alone; for if the things about which you ſtrive with them be not of God, it will fall of it ſelf, and come to nothing, though you meddle not with it; but <hi>if it be of God</hi> (as ſurely it is) then <hi>take heed what you do,</hi> for you will never be able to deſtroy it, though you oppoſe it with all your Power, and therein be found fighters againſt God? neither will thoſe Laws by which you proceed againſt them, juſtifie your proceedings any more, than they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99944:4"/>were juſtified who proceeded againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> the <hi>three Children, Chriſt</hi> himſelf, his <hi>Apoſtles, Servants</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> in Ages paſt, who could all of them plead, they had Laws and Decrees for what they did, and many of them proceeding more according to thoſe Laws then in being, than is done at this day; yet you your ſelves will condemn them for Perſecutors and wicked men, and therein you judge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and you may conſider what was their end, and what they brought upon themſelves by ſo doing, though many of them did it ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thinking thereby they did God ſervice: And it would be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and more honour to the King and better ſervice to him, by all that are in Authority under him, to endeavour the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and preventing of Wickedneſs and Prophaneſs, that it might be removed out of the Land, that ſo his Throne might be eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs; than the putting of thoſe Laws in execution againſt peaceable people about Religion, becauſe they cannot ſubmit to things contrary to the perſwaſion of their conſciences.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, be this known unto you all, That whatſoever may be in your minds concerning us, or in the purpoſe of your hearts to do unto us, or to cauſe us to ſuffer upon this account, as you ſhall not thereby provoke us to render unto you evil for evil, or to move a hand againſt you, or any wayes practiſe or endeavour your hurt, ruine, overthrow or deſtruction, (though we are well aſſured that if you proceed againſt us, you will thereby provoke the Lord againſt your ſelves, and bring ruine upon your ſelves) yet our hand ſhall not be upon you, or againſt you, but rather pitty you, and pray for your converſion, and endeavour your good in what we may; neither ſhall all your hard dealing with us, and cruelty towards us, prevail with us to do any thing contrary to the perſwaſion of our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or to bow or conform to any thing which is againſt the righteous Law of God, and the Requiring of his Spirit in our hearts; for we will bow down unto the Lord, but we will not bow down unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; neither ſhall we do any thing which is forbidden by your Laws, or omit the doing of any thing which is required by your Laws, out of wilfulneſs, ſtubbornneſs, pride, or contempt againſt your perſons or authority, but ſhall ſubmit unto you in all lawful things; only when your Laws come in competition with the Law of God in our Conſciences, then judge you which we ought rather to obey; for if we ſin againſt the Teſtimony of our Conſciences, who then can give
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99944:5"/>us peace? and whether it be not better for us in ſuch caſes to truſt the Lord, and to fall into his hands than into yours? for if we are faithful unto him, and obey him in what he requires, he is able to deliver us out of your hands, and to reſtrain your wrath; but if we diſobey him, by obeying you, and by ſubmitting to your Commands, you cannot ſave us from the ſtroke of his Hand, nor deliver us from his Wrath; Therefore it is our firm reſolution, and the purpoſe of our hearts (whatever the Lord may yet ſuffer you to do unto us, or inflict upon us) not at all to defile our Conſciences by doing any thing which we are perſwaded is contrary to his will; for we have counted the coſt of this work, and are freely given up unto the Lord, to be diſpoſed of at his pleaſure, either in doing or ſuffering, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cauſe and not our own, we being onely Inſtruments in his hand; ſo that the controverſie is between you and God, and to him do we look, and commit our ſelves, and the keeping of our ſouls in well-doing, and leave it to him to plead our Innocency, and the Righteouſneſs of this Cauſe with all that riſe up againſt us. And this is written and tendred to your ſerious conſideration, in that Love which would have none to periſh in their gainſaying, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that all might turn from their wickedneſs and live.</p>
